<p>Today I had to process some data, which was inside an unordered list, using the Python language.</p>
<p>Some computations employed all the list items, others were based only on related ones.</p>
<!-- more -->
<p>The data was arranged in tuples, each one contained a main value among others.</p>
<p>That value (let's call it "key"), identified a relation with other tuples.</p>
<p>Simplifying it, quite a bit, was something similar to this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">items = [(1, "a"), (3, "q"), (2, "c"), (2, "x"), (1, "z")]
</code></pre>
<p>The problem could be solved using some nested "while" iterations.</p>
<p>But actually, I wanted something more brief and readable.</p>
<p>Then, I looked for an alternative, and found itertools.</p>
<p>First I've loaded the required module:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">from itertools import groupby
</code></pre>
<p>Then, the final solution was much like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">for key, group in groupby(sorted(items), lambda x: x[0]):
    # Do something with the key
    print(key)
    for tuple in group:
        # Process each tuple with same key
        print(tuple)
    # Other statements
    print("^^^^^^^^^")
</code></pre>
<p>There are some remarkable points in this code:</p>
<ul>
<li>The list needs to be <code>sorted</code> previously, so keys can be matched up.</li>
<li>I've used a <code>lambda</code> in order to select which element is the key.</li>
<li>The key can be accessed individually.</li>
<li>Related tuples can accessed via the group variable.</li>
<li>Each item inside each group still contains the key.</li>
</ul>
<p>This code would print something like this:</p>
<pre><code>1
(1, 'a')
(1, 'z')
^^^^^^^^^
2
(2, 'c')
(2, 'x')
^^^^^^^^^
3
(3, 'q')
^^^^^^^^^
</code></pre>
<p>At the end, this method was cleaner than using iterations by hand.</p>
